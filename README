SparqlTransmission

It is a class that wraps the transmission of a SPARQL request to a SPARQL
end-point.

You need to provide the URI of the SPARQL end-point to use the class, and
the request.

The execution of the request is done in the object of the class, and it
returns the result parsed into a hash.
