h1. SparqlTransmission for Ruby

SparqlTransmission is a ruby library that handles the transmission of your SPARQL query to a SPARQL end-point, such as DBpedia (http://dbpedia.org/sparql), and format the response nicely so you can use it in your code.

h2. Installing

You can install the latest SparqlTransmission gem

<code>gem install SparqlTransmission</code>

h2. How to use

First, create a SparqlTransmission object with the URL of the end-point you'd like to query

<code>
	require 'SparqlTransmission'
	st = SparqlTransmission.new('http://dbpedia.org/sparql')
</code>

Now enter your query

<code>
st.query = %[
  SELECT ?subject ?predicat ?object
  WHERE 
  { 
     ?subject ?predicat ?object
  }
]
</code>

You can now iterate over your results and print them

<code>
st.execute_query.results.each do |res|
  puts res
end
</code>
